# Mithril
A small linux terminal based text editor.
I am currently working on it, but it is and will remain a learning project and not an actual thing.

I am also learning C through it, as it is my very first C project ever.

I am inspiring myself of the tutorial found [here](http://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html)

# Fonctionalities:

- Multiple editing tabs (but not all visible at the same time)
- Opening / Saving / Creating files
- It converts tabs to four spaces (yes)
